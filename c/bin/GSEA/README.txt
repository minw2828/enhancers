########## GSEA ##########
* Itâ€™s necessary to separate GSEA into calculation and plots, 
  because the requirements of visualization can change by supervisor.

* The best way to organise results are leaving them in their own 
  individual directory. Depends on what I want to retrieve for 
  viewing, COPY them to report directory, before taking them out 
  from BASC to my windows.
